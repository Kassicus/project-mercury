# Project Mercury

### Game Concept
Based on a word doc that I found on an old computer with a very rough draft of a game.
Earth sends ships on very long many many lightyear voyages. Faster than light travel is not invented yet.
Due to automated systems having issues when traversing this great of distance, there is a team of individuals on each ship that don't get put into cryochambers.
These individuals are responsible for managing and defending the ship while it is on its travel.
They are responsible for maintenance and repair, improvement of systems and defending ships from a known hostile alien force that occupies a stretch of the corridor the human ships travel through.
These ships are small, lightly armed and hard to locate. Designed as a means to send supply and people out to earths colonies on new planets. They don't get a military escort.

### Wake Up
The previous *insert role name here* has been significantly injured and is no longer able to perform their requried tasks. They have initiated the thawing process on you before succumbing to their injuries. When you wake up you are greeted by a brief pre-recorded message and then stumble across the body of your previous *role* member and a hand written note he has left for you detailing a few things he was actively working on before he got injured. As well as some information on how he got injured and what you can do to prevent yourself from meeting his same fate. This information, in addition to a jumpsuit and a datapad in your crew chamber are all you get before you are released to manage the ship.

### Player Responsibility
Player must manage all aspects of the ship for as long as they live. If the player becomes fatally injured, or has come into bad health or old age, but is able to begin the thaw process for another replacement then they get to continue on as the replacement. If they die before initiating a thawing process they end the game. If they thaw out another individual while they are in good health the new *role* member will become unreasonably upset with the current *role* wasting his life and kill the player resulting in and end game.

While the player is alive they need to maintain and repair the ships navigation systems, radiation shielding, engines, fuel cells, power generation and storage and weapons systems. They also need to defend the ship from any outside force that tries to attack it. They can do this by manning the turret control system in the bridge and using the limited weapon supply of the ship, or they can wait for the enemy to attempt to board and fight from the inside of the ship using the supplies in the ships armory.

All ship supplies are limited. They do not get restocked after each crew members life ends. The player must manage the supplies to last the duration of the trip out to the colony
